# Coursera-Standford-ML-Course

Arguably one of the best and most famous course in the field of machine learning. But how good is it? Is it really worth it in 2021.  
[Here](https://harshalgarg.medium.com/machine-learning-course-by-andrew-ng-on-coursera-worth-it-in-2021-e5d6086c69a7) are my thoughts on this course.

The solution of the assignments of the course is in [Assignment Solution](https://github.com/gargharshal/Coursera-Standford-ML-Course/tree/master/Assignment%20Solution)

A few extra points added by me and correction to the slides that were provided in the course is in [Andrew Ng ML - Notes](https://github.com/gargharshal/Coursera-Standford-ML-Course/tree/master/Andrew%20Ng%20ML%20-%20Notes)
